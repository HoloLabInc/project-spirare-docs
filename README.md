This repository contains documentation for the file format defined in Project Spirare.

## Project Spirare

Project Spirare is a project that defines and implements a versatile format for describing 3D content.

In this project, a format called POML is defined, which has the following features:

- XML-based format
- Ability to define the placement of files, such as 3D models, images, and videos
- Independent of specific engines or applications
- Loadable at runtime

By using POML and libraries for loading POML, the same 3D content can be used in various applications.
